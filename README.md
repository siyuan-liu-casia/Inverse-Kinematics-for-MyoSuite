# Inverse-Kinematics-for-MyoSuite(IK)
A Inverse Kinematics calculation repo for [MyoSuite](https://github.com/MyoHub/myosuite).

A method for calculating joint angles through site point trajectories in a MyoSuite environment. 
In this code, the trajectory of the site is simply interpolated between the starting point and the target point. 
Alternatively, the interpolated_points can be directly assigned as the site trajectory for calculation.
